This page details the communication channels used by developers in the Hydra community.  For more
information on broader community communication, please see the Hydra wiki
[Get in touch!](https://wiki.duraspace.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=43910187) page.


## Tech Call

There is a weekly Hydra technical call for developers and other folks who are contributing code or
are actively using the core Hydra plugins & components.  This is a great forum for:

* Announcing new releases of core gems or Hydra heads
* Asking for feedback on proposed changes
* Asking for code review, or making sure there is consensus before merging a contentious PR.
* Letting people know about upcoming events, special topics calls, activity in related communities.

Connection Info:

* Call-In Info: 1-641-715-3660, access code 651025
* Time: 9:00am Pacific / Noon Eastern
* The agenda and notes will be posted in the [Hydra wiki Meetings and Calls](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Notes+from+Meetings+and+Calls)
  page.  Please add agenda items before the call.


## Slack

There is a Hydra Slack team that is used for discussion, questions, announcements, interest groups,
and working groups. Anyone can create a new channel within the Hydra Slack team once they have
registered for an account.  Slack is the best place for real-time communication and getting quick
answers to questions.

* Slack team: https://project-hydra.slack.com
* Signup form: http://slack.projecthydra.org/ (If this form does not work, you may want to use [this backup form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1cRJaOTo2pHAeMzfE3hKL3toPHF2_e4ZXw3ufOXlF2vU/viewform) If you need help getting connected, ping slack@projecthydra.org and someone will be in touch.

A tutorial can be found at https://project-hydra.slack.com/getting-started.  Slack has clients for Mac, PC, Linux, and mobile devices, and may be used via any web browser.


## Mailing List

There is a Google Groups mailing list for technical discussions of Hydra and all of its components:
https://groups.google.com/group/hydra-tech.  The mailing list is the best place for technical
discussions, asking more involved questions, and making general announcements about upcoming
changes.


## Wikis

* The [Hydra Developer Wiki](https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra/wiki) is the main place for
  techincal documentation, including tutorials and How-To articles.

* The [Hydra Wiki](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/The+Hydra+Project) contains general
  project information, meeting agendas and notes, and information about events like HydraConnect
  or Developer Congresses.
  * Email sysadmin@duraspace.org to request an account.


## Events and Conferences

* [Hydra Connect](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Connect+Meetings) is the Hydra
  community's annual conference, typically in late September or early October.
* Developer Congresses are developer-focused meetings that are occasionally scheduled, either as
  standalone events, or attached to another event or conference.  These events are announced on
  the hydra-tech mailing list, and the exact format varies somewhat from event to event.
* [Hydra Camp](https://curationexperts.com/our-services/hydra-camp/) is a four-day training event
  held a couple times a year.  Targeted at developers who are new to Hydra, Hydra Camp covers basic
  Rails programming, Git workflow, Hydra and Blacklight.
* In addition to Hydra-specific events, many developers in the Hydra community attend other
  conferences, such as [Code4lib](http://code4lib.org/conference),
  [LDCX](http://library.stanford.edu/projects/ldcx), and [Open Repositories](http://openrepositories.org/).


## IRC

Slack is more active, but there is still a #projecthydra IRC channel on chat.freenode.net.  Connect
using your favorite IRC client, or using http://webchat.freenode.net/.  If you are new to IRC, the
Code4lib [IRC wiki page](http://code4lib.org/irc) is a good introduction.
