[meetings, mailing lists, and other communication channels](communication.md), and
expect participants to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Code+of+Conduct)

## Hydra is a framework
Hydra is a framework for building repository applications, integrating:
* [Fedora](http://fedorarepository.org/) for robust, scalable storage
* [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) for a search engine with great performance
* [Blacklight](http://projectblacklight.org/) for full-featured discovery

and allowing you to take advantage of the broader [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) ecosystem.
